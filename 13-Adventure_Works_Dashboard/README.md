# ADVENTURE WORKS DASHBOARD

This dashboard was created based on an Excel file with fictitious information about store sales and its main goal is to show how this type of data can be structured and analyzed.

It is worth remembering that none of the information on this dashboard is private or confidential.

The dashboard was built in three pages, on the Exec Summary Page we have a data slicer that serves as a filter for the report (1), we have card that shows the product with more orders (2), a table with information about the products (3), a tree map that shows the number of orders by Category (4), a bar chart with total orders by category (5), a few KPIs that shows monthly orders, monthly returns and monthly revenue compared with the previous month (6).
