# Route Map

Route map is designed to visualize trajectories of objects, such as taxis, vessels, airplanes, and hurricanes. 

Specifically, a trajectory dataset often contains three aspects of information: time, geo-coordinate, and attribute. 

In this visual, you can draw the spatial-temporal information on a map with polylines, then use line styles (e.g., colors and widths) to encode desired attributes.
