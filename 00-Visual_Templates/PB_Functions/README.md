# Power BI Functions

There are more than 600 M functions in Power BI. It is extremely difficult to remember them all. 

But, there is a way to create a table that lists all the functions and also gives you information about each function and all its arguments.

To create this table, follow the next steps:

1 - Go to 'Get Data' --> 'Blank query';
2 - On the fx, write =#shared + 'Enter';
3 - Click on 'Into Table'.

A table will be created with all the Power BI elements. Now, you can just look for the functions you want to use and click on 'Value' on the Value Column and a new window will open with all the information about the function.
