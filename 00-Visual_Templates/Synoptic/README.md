# Synoptic

Synoptic Panel by OKVIZ enables you to show one or more images called “maps” – which are not necessarily geographic maps. 

Maps are made up of areas, whose specific meaning is provided by the underlying data. 

Areas can be highlighted or colored dynamically, and you can display several pieces of information over these areas. 

The design of the maps can be achieved with a vector graphic editor, or by using our companion tool [Synoptic Designer](https://synoptic.design).
