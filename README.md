# BI Dashboards Portifolio

This repository contains a set of individual Power BI projects that were made both to serve as a portfolio of my work and also to represent different ways of analyzing data from the most diverse areas of business.

Here we have Dashboards on movie series, such as Star Wars and Harry Potter, analysis of vehicle theft data in the state of SÃ£o Paulo, arrests made by the New York police, analysis of the stock market, analysis of data for follow-up of projects, logistics, inventory, customers, among many others.

Each of these reports was developed with the aim of presenting a data analysis consistent with the type of information to which it refers, as well as the use of the most appropriate graphic visuals. Among them, we have different types of graphs, tables, maps, cards, KPI's and so on.

I hope that this repository can serve not only as a presentation about my work and my skills, but also, it can serve as support material for those who want to learn more about the Power BI tool and also about data analysis.
