# FINANCIAL MARKET

This dashboard was created based on information about the dollar exchange rate and its variation and also on the IGP-M and IPCA rates and its main goal is to show how this type of data can be structured and analyzed.

For dollar information, the info comes from a [json document](https://www.bcb.gov.br/estabilidadefinanceira/historicocotacoes) provided by the Central Bank of Brazil - BCB.

For Selic information, it comes from a [web connection](https://www.bcb.gov.br/controleinflacao/historicotaxasjuros) from the BCB.

For IGPM info, it comes from a [json document](https://api.bcb.gov.br/dados/serie/bcdata.sgs.4175/dados?formato=json) provided by BCB.

And for IPCA info, it comes from a [API connection](https://apisidra.ibge.gov.br/values/t/1419/n1/all/v/all/p/all/c315/7169,7170,7445,7486,7558,7625,7660,7712,7766,7786/d/v63%202,v66%204,v69%202,v2265%202?formato=json)

All of its information is publicly accessible and available to everyone who wants to access its information.

It is worth remembering that none of the information on this dashboard is private or confidential.
